## 🎓 Project Background

As part of my minor project, I worked on an **AI-IoT based Lie Detection System** that later turned into a **research paper**. Our goal? Replace outdated, invasive polygraph systems with a real-time, non-contact, and AI-driven alternative.

...

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Python + OpenCV | Frame processing, image analysis |
| MediaPipe | Facial landmark tracking |
| Arduino + MAX30102 | Real-time heart rate sensor |
| MT-CNN | Emotion detection |
| Matplotlib | Visualization |
| PySerial | Hardware communication |

...

## 📊 Research Achievements

- 89% accuracy in detecting facial-based deception
- 30% reduction in false positives over polygraph
- Real-time output with dashboard and alerts

...

## 🌍 Where Can This Be Used?

- HR Interviews
- Virtual therapy sessions
- Border security screening
- Remote exam proctoring

...

## 📢 Interested in Collaborating?

I'm open to:
- Internships in AI/ML/IoT
- Research extensions of this project
- Public demo talks or webinars
